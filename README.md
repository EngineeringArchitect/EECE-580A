# Cyber Physical Systems Research Project - Colonel Blotto Games

## Colonel Blotto Games

The goal of this project is to improe the current Colonel Blotto games MATLAB files

The changes and analyses I intend to make:
- Main Goal: Increase the speed in which the MATLAB files make the calculations. Either keep them as MATLAB files or using python to help improve the speed.
- Check that the files run correctly.
- Try to add more than 1 "A" vector. Analyze: Who does this benefit more: the attacker or the defender?
- How does the equilibrium change the cost values? How does the equilibrium change?
