# Cyber Physical Systems Research Project - Colonel Blotto Games

## What are the Colonel Blotto Games (CBG)
Colonel Blotto Games is a type of zero-sum game where the players, usually called colonels, have to distribute their limited number of resources over a series of battlefields inorder to win the game. THe player with the most resources on the battlefield wins that game. The payoff of the game is the number of battlefields won. The concept of CBG has many real world applications such as in smart grids and controllers.

In this version there are a series of physical nodes and cyber nodes. The physical nodes are connected through the cyber nodes. The user can only access the physical nodes through the cyber nodes. Each physical node is connected to either 1 or more cyber nodes. If the attacker to the networked system manages to take down one of the cyber nodes then all the physical nodes attached to it are knocked out.

In the given files, they each aids in the calculation of CBG analysis.

In this project the CBG is the network such as the 
The goal of this project is to improve the current Colonel Blotto games MATLAB files

The changes and analyses I intend to make:
1. Main Goal: Increase the speed in which the MATLAB files make the calculations. Either keep them as MATLAB files or using python to help improve the speed.
2. Check that the files run correctly.
3. Try to add more than 1 "A" vector. Analyze: Who does this benefit more: the attacker or the defender?
4. How does the equilibrium change the cost values? How does the equilibrium change?
