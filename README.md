# Cyber Physical Systems Research Project - Colonel Blotto Games

## Colonel Blotto Games

The goal of this project is to improe the current Colonel Blotto games MATLAB files

The changes and analyses I intend to make:
1. Main Goal: Increase the speed in which the MATLAB files make the calculations. Either keep them as MATLAB files or using python to help improve the speed.
2. Check that the files run correctly.
3. Try to add more than 1 "A" vector. Analyze: Who does this benefit more: the attacker or the defender?
4. How does the equilibrium change the cost values? How does the equilibrium change?
